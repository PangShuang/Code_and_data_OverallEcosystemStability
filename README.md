## Instructions

All analyses were done in `R`. All data needed to reproduce the analyses is available in the `data`folder. 
The `code` folder reports contains three R markdown files to reproduce 
the statistical analyses, the qualitative literature review as well as the calculation of
overall ecosystem stability. The reports are also available as pdfs in the `reports`folder.

Please also note our [interactive shiny app](https://frankpennekamp.shinyapps.io/Overall_ecosystem_stability_demo/) to illustrate the overall ecosystem stability concept.
