## Instructions

All analyses were done in `R`. The `code` folder reports contains three R markdown files to reproduce 
the statistical analyses, the qualitative literature review as well as the calculation of
overall ecosystem stability. The reports are also available as pdfs in the `reports`folder.

Please also note our shiny app to illustrate the overall ecosystem stability concept: [](https://frankpennekamp.shinyapps.io/Overall_ecosystem_stability_demo/)
